# Neuromarketing-Taste-Classification
This repository contains the code and data for a neuromarketing study that uses a brain-computer interface (BCI) framework with EEG and fNIRS signals to classify the five fundamental tastes using two deep learning architectures: a Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (BiLSTM) network and a Transformer encoder.
